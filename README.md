# TinyDTLS
Tinydtls is a library for Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) covering both the client and the server state machine. It is implemented in C and provides support for the mandatory cipher suites and provides basic support for DTLS with pre-shared key mode. This DTLS implementation for Contiki OS supports TLS\_PSK\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8 cipher suite (described in draft-mcgrew-tls-aes-ccm-04) only.  This code uses SHA2 algorithm to implement SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. TinyDTLS.
